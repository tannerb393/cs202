write a program that allows you two set the values of two different polynomials ranging
from 0 degree polynomial to 9th degree polynomial and to also set the value of the coeficcient
that corresponds to each of the exponents in order from the highest to the lowest. 

The two polynomials then be used in different math situations for adding, subtracting, multiplying,
dividing, testing for equality, evaluating given f(x), differentiation, integration, and definite 
integration.

the program must be able to assign the value of one polynomial spot to another (=), output a
polynomial (<<) amd input a polynomial (>>)
